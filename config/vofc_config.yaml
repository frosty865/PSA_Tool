# VOFC Engine Configuration
# This file configures the VOFC (Vulnerability and Options for Consideration) extraction engine

VOFC_ENGINE_TOPICS:
  # Enable narrative risk pattern detection
  narrative_risk: true
  
  # Enable thematic expansion (look for related themes)
  thematic_expansion: true
  
  # Target number of vulnerabilities to extract per document
  target_vulnerabilities_per_doc: 10
  
  # Target number of OFCs per vulnerability
  target_ofcs_per_vulnerability: 3

# Document-specific prompt biases
# These are applied when processing documents matching the pattern
document_biases:
  "USSS":
    prompts:
      - "Focus on systemic and behavioral vulnerabilities, not IT or cyber."
      - "Look for narrative findings and recommended actions."
      - "Emphasize threat assessment, leakage indicators, and behavioral patterns."
  
  "Averting":
    prompts:
      - "Focus on systemic and behavioral vulnerabilities, not IT or cyber."
      - "Look for narrative findings and recommended actions."
  
  "NTAC":
    prompts:
      - "Focus on protective intelligence and threat assessment methodologies."
      - "Look for behavioral indicators and information sharing patterns."
  
  "FBI":

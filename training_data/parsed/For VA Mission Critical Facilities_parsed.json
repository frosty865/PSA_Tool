The ISC \nSecurity Design Criteria is a controlled document and cannot be distributed to VA A/E \nconsultants. 1.3.1 Concentric Levels of Control and Protection \nThe physical security of facilities requires the use of concentric levels of control and \nprotection to provide progressively enhanced levels of security to deter, prevent, detect, \ndelay, and respond to threats in the protection of assets. The concept of concentric levels of \ncontrol is to protect the central asset behind layers of security measures such that it is least \nexposed to the threats.

The more effective the perimeter barrier and screening are the less protection is needed within \nthe site, such as between buildings, from patient and visitor parking and the building lobby, \nand from the site entrance to the other buildings on the site. In highly urban areas where the \nVA building may front on a city street with no standoff or separation, the building and its \noccupants can only be protected from hazards of breaking and entering, vandalism, and even \nexplosive or armed attack by hardening the building itself to resist, which may lead to \nundesirable solutions such as fa\u00e7ades with minimum openings and a fortress-like appearance. 1.3.2 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design \nVA follows the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED, \nsee www.cpted.net). CPTED strategies include elements of natural surveillance, natural \naccess control, and natural territorial reinforcement. CPTED promotes the principles that \nproper design and effective use of the built environment can discourage, reduce, or remove \npotential crime risks. CPTED should be used to evaluate VA site and building designs to \ncreate and enhance the concentric circles or layers of security protection."

It is not possible to eliminate all risk to a facility and every project will face resource \nlimitations. Cost effective risk management is a requirement of every project. As part of the \nplanning phase of a new mission critical facility or major alterations of an existing mission \ncritical facility a risk assessment must be performed, to determine project- or site-specific \nrequirements or modifications to the physical security design requirements, taking onto \naccount the Hazard Vulnerability Assessment (HVA) and Comprehensive Emergency \nManagement Plan (CEMP) for the facility.

Background \nThe National Center for Education Statistics reports that a total of 132,217 elementary and secondary \nschools (traditional, charter, and private) were operating in the United States during the 2009-2010 school \nyear.1 Approximately 52.3 million students were enrolled at these schools.2 Elementary and secondary \nschools are relatively open-access, limited egress community congregation points for children. In \ngeneral, schools are designed to provide a warm and inviting environment to encourage learning. Unfortunately, student populations may be at risk of mass casualties from natural disasters and man-made \nhazards. Schools are susceptible to being damaged by weather-related events, and infectious diseases \ncould spread easily among students, teachers, and staff. In addition, school environments have been \nsuccessfully targeted by armed attackers in the past. In some schools, security responses to the threat of \narmed attacks such as barring windows and controlling access points with metal detectors are criticized \nfor resembling a prison environment rather than a learning environment."

The security practices guide includes options for consideration in \ndeveloping a security plan that builds from existing comprehensive assessment efforts (e.g., culture and \nclimate, school threat assessment) and blends a number of security practices to achieve an effect where \nthreats are either deterred or delayed and detected in advance of creating harm. In the case of a detected \nthreat, a security plan should provide for timely assessment of the threat, create time for selecting an \nappropriate response to a threat and facilitate transition into an effective recovery, if necessary. To be \ncost effective, the security plan should implement solutions that serve multiple safety, security, and \nschool emergency management objectives while ensuring a nurturing school environment. The first step to develop a comprehensive school security program is to identify the threats that \npotentially jeopardize the physical well-being of the individuals in the school community. The next \nsection will review some potential threats a school community may face."

Threats and Vulnerabilities \nIdentifying and evaluating any known or potential threat(s) to a given facility is a preliminary component \nof a security assessment. The results of a security assessment will guide the process of developing a \nsecurity plan. A proper security plan will aim to deter or mitigate a threat by reducing the school \ncommunity\u2019s vulnerability to the identified threat. As numerous events over the past several years have \ndemonstrated, elementary and secondary schools can face both internal and external threats of violence. Internal threats of violence can come from students, teachers, or staff members who are accepted \nmembers within the school facility and whose access to the school is authorized by school administrators. Internal threats may be mitigated by school policies and procedures as outlined in Section 3: Mitigation \nand Prevention. External threats of violence can come from individuals who are not directly affiliated \nwith the school, and who appear at the facility without authorized access and with the intent to inflict \nharm on the school community."

Such hazards can affect the safety of elementary \nand secondary school employees and students, as well as the \nfacility\u2019s ability to carry out normal operations. \u2022 \nIn May 2011, a tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, \ndestroyed approximately 2,000 buildings, including Joplin \nHigh School. The school was so badly damaged that it could \nnot be used when the new school year started three (3) months later.4 \n2.1.2 Targeted Violence \n \nIn addition to threats posed by extreme acts of nature or man-made accidents, elementary and secondary \nschools are vulnerable to pre-planned attacks of targeted violence committed by individuals using a \nvariety of tactics to inflict harm on a school community. Individuals who target a school to inflict harm \ncould use firearms; improvised explosive devices (IEDs); vehicle-borne IEDs (VBIEDs); chemical, \nbiological, or radiological attacks; or arson that may result in a number of casualties and/or damage to \nschool facilities. Perpetrators may have a wide variety of weapons and tactics available to achieve their \nobjectives and may demonstrate the ability to plan and conduct complex attacks against multiple targets."

Active shooter events occurred in \nan academic setting 17% of the time.6 As the following examples demonstrate, deliberate attacks on \nelementary and secondary schools pose a real threat that can inflict considerable harm."

Taken together, the sheer size of the country\u2019s school system, the \npredictability of school schedules and holidays, and their attractiveness as a \u201csoft target,\u201d can leave \nschools vulnerable to a number of threats. These vulnerabilities create several industry-wide security and \nprotection related challenges. \u2022 \nPrevention of attacks. Predictable school schedules and well publicized school holidays allow \nindividuals to conduct surveillance at times when they will be less likely to be detected either because \nno one is present at the school or because there are so many people present that the individual would \nbe able to blend into a crowd. In addition, the perception that schools are \u201csoft targets\u201d and have little \nsecurity may make them a more attractive target for individuals looking to carry out an attack on a \nlarge group of individuals. \u2022 \nDisease control and prevention. Since schools are centers of community life, members of the \ncommunity may intentionally or accidentally expose a school community to an infectious disease. It \nis imperative that educators and administrators work with state and local health officials to establish \nhealth policies and procedures to prepare for, respond to, and recover from a potential pandemic."

The unpredictability of natural disasters and threats to safety \nfrom outside the school community make it difficult to prepare for them. Effective planning, to the \nextent possible, and preparedness training for potential natural disasters and other external threats to \nschool safety enables school personnel to identify their roles for evacuation and/or relief efforts that \nmay be necessary in the event of an unforeseen catastrophe. 2.2.1 Open Access \n \n\u2022 \nRelatively open access to school grounds and buildings. All schools require relatively easy access \nfor students and staff during school hours and during large after-school events. Depending on the size \nof the school and the school population, building and fire codes usually require multiple egress doors 7 \n \nin case of an emergency evacuation. In addition, many school buildings in the United States have \nbeen constructed to achieve an inviting and open-to-the-community feeling, with multiple buildings, \nbig windows, multiple entrances and exits, and little opportunities for privacy. These layouts may not \nlend themselves to simple implementation of many common protective measures; however, many \ndistricts and schools have successfully addressed the aforementioned \u201copenness\u201d and implemented \nsubstantial access control and monitoring systems. \u2022 \nProximity of schools and neighboring facilities, especially in urban areas."

These surrounding \ncharacteristics of a school need to be considered when working to maintain effective perimeter \nsecurity. Appropriate fencing may lend to more effective perimeter security. Schools need to be able \nto effectively respond to threatening incidents in the surrounding community that require a school to \nactivate emergency operations procedures, such as lockdowns. \u2022 \nLimited or no vehicle access controls. The layouts of most schools and school grounds permit close \nproximity of vehicles to buildings and areas where students congregate. These include parking areas, \ndriveways on school grounds (including long avenues of approach for bus access), and nearby streets. Some schools have no vehicle barriers near the main entrances, other vulnerable parts of the \nbuildings, or student gathering areas. \u2022 \nLack of vehicle inspection. There are virtually no security controls on the contents of vehicles \nentering parking areas at elementary and secondary schools. A potential perpetrator of an attack could \ntransport many types of weapons or explosives to the school grounds in a vehicle. \u2022 \nLack of control of vendor and contractor personnel. Individuals who deliver parcels, food \nsupplies, or stock vending machines are often given unescorted access to schools and the contents of \nthe packages they carry are not inspected. \u2022 \nLack of inspection of student articles."

School grounds are generally not secured, leaving HVAC units and other \ncritical building utility supply components (e.g., water, electric power, natural gas service) easily \naccessible. 2.2.2 Large Concentrations of Students Outside School Buildings \n \nLarge concentrations of students frequently gather in open areas outside school buildings for physical \neducation classes, recess, assemblies, ceremonies, and daily arrival and departure. These events often \noccur at regularly scheduled, well-advertised times, which increase a school\u2019s vulnerability to attack \nbecause a potential attacker is well aware of the event and amount of people who are likely to be present. 2.2.3 Limited Security Control of After-School Events \n \nSchools are used for a variety of functions after school hours, such as craft fairs, fundraisers, religious \nservices, etc. In addition, some schools may share facilities \u2013 such as auditoriums, music/theater facilities, \npools, stadiums, or other sports facilities \u2013 with the local community.

Prevention, Protection, and Mitigation \nPrevention, protection, and mitigation address what schools, districts, and community partners can do to \nreduce or eliminate risk to life and property. These processes may differ depending on whether the threat \nof harm is from an internal threat or individual affiliated with the school (i.e. student or employee), an \nexternal threat or individual not directly affiliated with the school, or other natural hazards/manmade \nthreats. This section will highlight threat assessments, identify potential attack indicators, recommend protective \nmeasures in coordination with community partners, and discuss reporting procedures and long-term \nprevention programs. A significantly important element of an effective security program incorporates a \nprocess to achieve and maintain situational awareness and understanding about what is occurring in or \naround your school environment. Situational understanding and the ability to discover internal threats to \nthe school community can be achieved and maintained by fostering a culture where staff, teachers, and \nadministrators consciously evaluate available information from the school environment to identify and \nassess potential threats of violence to the school community."

The sensors in a school environment are not all technological; the majority of the best \nsensors are humans. In a school setting sensors can be the whole community surrounding the school, \nschool staff, teachers, school resource officers, and students. A security threat assessment can be \nconducted to gather information and identify potential threats, assess the nature of the threat, and select \nthe most appropriate course of action to manage and mitigate that threat in order to maintain a safe school \nenvironment for students and teachers. In 2002, the United States Secret Service in partnership with the U.S. Department of Education identified \na number of planning and behavioral indicators that demonstrate a student may be thinking about, or \npreparing to commit, an act of violence at his or her school.11 This study, referred to as the Safe School \nInitiative, analyzed 37 attacks at K-12 schools in order to better understand the pre-attack behaviors and \ncommunications of 41 students who carried out these attacks.

Addressable notification systems can help control the \nflow of personnel by directing them to go in a different direction or to follow a specific emergency \nprocedure. Also, consider implementing a classroom communication system that can provide a rapid \nmeans for staff and students to alert the administration that a serious incident is taking place. Such \ncommunications systems can consist of a push-to-talk button installed on a wall, an identifiable telephone \nsystem, or other system.

Methods of \ncommunication should be implemented based on the unique needs of each school, district, and situation. 4.2.3 Evacuation, Lockdown, and Shelter-In-Place Policies and Procedures \n \nWhen an incident occurs, quickly determine whether students and staff need to be evacuated, locked \ndown or assume shelter in place. Evacuation requires all students and staff to leave the building. While \nevacuating to the school\u2019s field makes sense for a fire drill that only lasts a few minutes, it may not be an \nappropriate location for a longer period of time. The evacuation plan should include backup buildings to \nserve as emergency shelters, such as nearby community centers, religious institutions, businesses, or other \nschools. Evacuation plans should include contingencies for weather conditions as well. Evacuation \nprocedures should also include designated areas to provide specific needs.

A lockdown may also be called for when there is a crisis inside and movement within the \nschool may put students in jeopardy. All exterior doors are locked and students and staff stay in their \nclassrooms. Windows may also need to be covered. Shelter-in-place requires students and staff to immediately find a room with no or few windows, and take \nrefuge there. All windows, exterior doors, and other openings to the outside should be closed and locked. In addition, all fans, heating, and air conditioning systems should be turned off if possible to prevent any \nmaterials or agents from circulating through school ventilation systems. Active shooter situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Because active shooter situations are often \nover within 10 to 15 minutes, before law enforcement arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared \nboth mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation. In the event of an active shooter \nsituation, it is imperative to quickly determine the most reasonable way to protect your own life.

Recovery \nThe goal of recovery is to return to learning and restore the infrastructure of the school as quickly as \npossible. Focus on students and take as much time as needed for recovery. School staff can be trained to \ndeal with the emotional impact of a crisis, as well as to initially assess the emotional needs of students, \nstaff, and responders. One of the major goals of recovery is to provide a caring and supporting school and \ncommunity environment."

      "text": "20 \n \n6.1 \nAssemble a Crisis Intervention Team and Assess Emotional Needs \nof Staff, Students, Facilities, and Responders \n \nA Crisis Intervention Team is composed of individuals at either the district or school level involved in \nrecovery. Service providers in the community may want to assist after a crisis. With prior planning, those \nwith appropriate skills and certifications may be tasked to assist in recovery. Assess the emotional needs \nof all students and staff, and determine those who need intervention by a school counselor, social worker, \nschool psychologist, or other mental health professional. In addition, available services need to be \nidentified for families who may want to seek treatment for their children themselves. 6.2 \nKeep Students, Families and the Media Informed \n \nBe clear about what steps have been taken to tend to student safety after the crisis has occurred. Let \nfamilies and other community members know what support services the school and district is providing or \nwhat other community resources are available. Messages to students should be age appropriate. Create a \nJIC where information sharing is centralized. 6.3 \nReturn to the \u201cBusiness of Learning\u201d as Quickly As Possible \n \nExperts agree that the first order of business following a crisis is to return students to learning as quickly \nas possible. This may involve helping students and families cope with separations from one another with \nthe reopening of school after a crisis."

      "text": "6.4 \nProvide Stress Management \n \nTrauma experts emphasize the need to create a caring, warm, and trusting environment for students \nfollowing a crisis. Allow students to talk about how they felt and what they experienced during the \ntraumatic event. Younger children, who may not be able to fully express their feelings verbally, may \nbenefit from participating in creative activities, including drawing, painting, or writing stories. Engage \nolder adolescents in group discussion, and address any issues of guilt. In addtion, provide on-site \ncounselors for a minimum of one week after the incident. 6.5 \nRestore Infrastructure \n \nRestoring infrastructure is essential to the restoration of the teaching and learning environment. Restoring \ndamaged infrastructure after an emergency incident is a positive, tangible sign of recovery for students \nand staff. Restoring infrastructure after an incident provides an opportunity to evaluate incident response \nand implement new and effective protective measures if necessary. 6.6 \nEvaluate \n \nEvaluating recovery efforts will help prepare for the next crisis. Use several methods to evaluate recovery \nefforts. Conduct brief interviews with emergency responders, families, teachers, students, and staff. Focus \ngroups may also be helpful in obtaining candid information about recovery efforts. Evaluate what worked, \nwhat did not, and how operations or EOPs can be improved. Update and strengthen the EOP so that in a \ncrisis, no child is left behind."

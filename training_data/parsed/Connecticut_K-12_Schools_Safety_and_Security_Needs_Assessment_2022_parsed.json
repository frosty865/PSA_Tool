Project Design \nThe objective of this research was to identify the safety and security concerns of the \nprofessionals servicing K-12 schools throughout the state of Connecticut. The study also sought \nto identify the most ideal training time and delivery methods. The survey consisted of eight \nsections: consent, demographics, safety concerns and training needs, school climate, threat \nreporting and assessment, mental health crisis response, future research, and training delivery \nand scheduling. The survey consisted of 22 questions (see Appendix A). The questions were \ndelivered on the Survey Select platform and sent to a variety of mailing lists across employee \ncategories with the goal of casting the widest net. 2 \n \nResults \nThe first part of the survey includes a consent to participate. The total number of respondents \nwho consented to take the survey was 823. However, the highest response rate for any \nquestion was 763 respondents and the lowest response rate was 556."

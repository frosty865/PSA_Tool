Scenarios describe potential pathways from today to tomorrow, helping executives to look at a number of plausible possibilities and \ndevelop flexible options and timely responses to support resiliency to future risk. In recent years, researchers have developed a basis for the construction of comparable climate scenarios \u2014 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and \nShared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). RCPs are \u201cemissions scenarios\u201d that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases, \naerosols, and chemically active gases, as well as land use and land cover. SSPs are scenarios that project global socioeconomic changes based on different climate \npolicies. SSPs expand on RCPs to allow for a standardized comparison of society\u2019s choices and their resulting levels of climate change. To assess Choice\u2019s exposure to physical and transition risks, we performed an analysis under two scenarios:\n\u2022\nBusiness as usual, which corresponds to RCP8.5 and SSP5, and assumes continued use of fossil fuels, strong economic growth, and weak carbon policies. This \nscenario corresponds with expected global temperature increases at 3.5-4.5\u00baC above pre-industrial levels by 2100."

Climate risks and opportunities\nWe are subject to the physical and transition risk associated with climate change and extreme weather events. These risks include, among others:\n\u2022\nPhysical risks,\u00a0such as changes in sea levels, water shortages, droughts, and natural disasters\n\u2022\nTransition risks, such as changing consumer preferences and demand for travel along with changes in laws and regulations related to climate change, greenhouse \ngas emissions, energy policies, and sustainability. Choice continues to monitor climate-related risks and opportunities to the business on an ongoing basis. Based on our scenario assessment, we have prioritized \nChoice\u2019s top three risks and opportunities related to climate change as described below. Risks\n1. Extreme weather events (short to medium term, medium impact). Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, \nwildfires, or heat waves, could impact hotel operations and profitability. For example, hurricane damage in locations in the southeastern U.S. may cause property \ndamage and disrupt operations, resulting in costs to repair or lost revenue. 2.

Insurance policies may be unavailable or costly in certain markets due to changing climate conditions. 3. Changing stakeholder expectations (medium term, medium impact). A variety of Choice\u2019s stakeholders are increasingly focused on our sustainability practices \nincluding our efforts around climate and greenhouse gas emissions. These stakeholders include corporate travel managers, meeting planners, government clients, \ncurrent associates and potential future talent, and investors.

New products or services that support a low carbon economy (medium to long term, medium impact). As more consumers and companies focus on addressing \nthe impacts of climate change, there could be additional opportunities to build, buy, or partner in creating new products or services that support a low carbon \neconomy.

This dashboard also calculates hotels\u2019 carbon footprint, enabling franchisees \nto respond to those questions on corporate RFPs. Our Room to Be Green certification program provides guidance for franchisees on how to reduce their utilities usage \nand improve their energy efficiency.

Additionally, our brand portfolio tends to skew towards highway and small town locations, and we have comparatively less coastal exposure than some others in \nthe industry. However, the impacts of the physical risks of climate change on our franchised hotels could disrupt their operations, adversely affecting our profits and growth. Further, large-scale systemic risks or a significant increase in stranded assets due to physical damage or regulatory non-compliance could impact the ability of the \nhotel industry overall to attract new investments. In a decarbonized, 2\u00baC scenario, the physical risks of climate change are likely to be somewhat mitigated, though still present. Transition risks, including adapting to \nstricter regulations and changing consumer preferences, are likely to be even more important drivers in our business model.

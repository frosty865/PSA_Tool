They have the responsibility to express to our fellow citizens the \nstability and endurance of their government, while representing \nthe openness and transparency that is vital to our democracy. This \nresponsibility continues to motivate us today, even as we respond \nto changing security requirements that call for innovative\nphysical solutions. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) sees the evolving \nneed for security as an opportunity\u2014to achieve the best design, \ncontribute to the sustainability of the environment, create a \nportfolio of buildings that will endure into the future, provide safe \nand productive federal workplaces, and improve the communities \nin which we work. In meeting these responsibilities, we demonstrate how thoughtful \nsecurity design can represent permanence and encourage citizen \nparticipation."

These workplaces extend beyond the front door and the \ncurb; indeed, as a significant presence in neighborhoods across \nthe country, the quality of the federal workplace derives from \nthe economic, social, and environmental context in which our \npublic buildings reside. Security must support this vital urban \ndevelopment role that the government plays in this setting. The challenge is significant. Over the past several years, while \nmany projects in both the public and private sectors have devoted \nsubstantial resources to security, protection often has come at \nthe expense of the workplace and the surrounding environment, \nwith no significant risk reduction. At times, security concerns \nhave prompted design solutions that impede the public realm or \nhave driven agencies to leave urban locations altogether. These \napproaches undermine community vitality and compromise the \neveryday life of a facility for fear of the unlikely event."

In this Guide, we focus on the latter realm\u2014the ability of sites and \ntheir surroundings to contribute to effective risk reduction, while \nproviding high-quality environments. Site security is not just an \nobligation, but an opportunity. This Guide emphasizes practices that \nenhance both the security of federal buildings and the quality of the \npublic realm, at the levels of the street and the entire city. GSA created this Site Security Design Guide to assist the designers, \nsecurity experts, customers, and other decision-makers who are \nentrusted with developing security countermeasures at new and \nexisting GSA facilities. The process described in this Guide leads \nto secure, well-designed site security solutions that complement \nand respect their context.

Only by \nintegrating security throughout the \ndesign process can the Project \nTeam strike a responsible balance \nbetween consideration of risk, \navailable resources, and appropriate \nmitigation measures. designers strike a successful balance, creating public buildings \nthat attain both security and openness. A successful process, allowing conscientious decision-making through \ncollaboration and a thorough understanding of interrelated issues, \nis the foundation for achieving these goals. Any design project \nrequires hundreds of decisions during planning, design, and \nconstruction. However, security issues can be especially complex \nand challenging to both designers and laypeople. At each stage, there \nare specific design and security challenges, such as the following:\n\ue034 Determination of threats and vulnerabilities, which remain \n difficult to predict; \n\ue034 Decisions about what to protect, which may be fraught with \n emotion; and\n\ue034 Selection of countermeasures, which are often extremely expensive.

      "text": "Establishing realistic security strategies for a project involves recognizing the emotional nature of the subject and the fear that the \nthreat of terrorism often can bring to the discussion. It is important to remember that a specific project cannot eliminate all risk, \nbut may only mitigate it or shift it from one place to another. A strategic approach to risk reduction involves the following factors:\nAssessment of risk: What threats and vulnerabilities are most \napplicable to the specific property under discussion, rather than to \nthe entire federal inventory? Prioritization of risk: What risks represent the greatest vulnerability and can be reduced with countermeasures? Acceptance of risk: What risks cannot be realistically reduced? What risks are too remote to call for significant countermeasures? Adoption of efficient and sensitive risk-reduction strategies: \nWhat is the proper balance between reduction of risk and the \neveryday use of the site? What is the cost and benefit of each \nrisk-reduction strategy? This strategic approach lays the groundwork for any successful \nproject. It directs the focus of scarce resources, addresses timing of \nimplementation, and enables flexibility. The ability to reduce risk varies with each project. Each team must \ndevelop an effective and realistic strategy for its unique project \nrequirements, resources, and location. In some cases, construction \nof site security elements will be the best approach."

Some locations have limited opportunities \nfor physical improvement, and a focus on operational changes may \nbe the best strategy. On most projects, mitigation of every known risk is not practical. Taking a strategic approach means identifying the most acute risks \nand devoting scare resources accordingly. Team members must \nconsider strategies that offer the most benefits, prioritize them, and \ndevelop implementation plans based on available resources. \u201cIt is easy to say that no risk \nwill be accepted, although this is \nimpossible to deliver. Thinking \nstrategically about risk reduction \nmeans reducing the most pressing \nand solvable risks, while accepting \nothers. It means devoting scarce \nresources where they can do the \nmost good and having the courage \nto avoid countermeasures that bring \nsignificant cost or design impacts \nwithout a realistic reduction in risk.\u201d\n\u2014Supreme Court Justice Stephen \nBreyer, \u201cThe Importance of \nOpenness in an Era of Security,\u201d \nArchitectural Record, January 2006\nGot security envy?

To encourage resolution, DHS \ntracks the status of mandatory measures until they are complete. Understanding the relation between Design Basis Tactics and protective countermeasures is crucial to creative problem solving. This is \nbecause design can be used not only to respond to the required Levels \nof Protection, but also to modify the Design Basis Tactics. In turn, \nthis can open up new options to achieve the required performance. For example, the Design Basis Tactics might assume that a vehicle \nof a certain size and speed has the potential to ram a perimeter \nbarrier system. In response, the initial Design Criteria may recommend that the perimeter barrier be designed to allow no penetration \ninto the site by that design basis vehicle. The design team could \nchoose a perimeter barrier system to withstand a head-on strike \nby the design basis vehicle and ensure no penetration into the site. However, this response to the design basis vehicle\u2019s mass and speed \nlikely would require a very robust system, and site context, budget, \nor underlying conditions may make this solution undesirable for \nnon-security reasons."

As a result, the perimeter barrier system could achieve the required \nperformance level of the bollard system with a less robust construction. This more creative approach offers more design options \nwith significant opportunities to improve cost, compatibility, and \neffectiveness. The Security Charrette (described in detail on page 85) is an \nimportant step in developing such innovative solutions. This is \na recently developed process that is intended to support the \nMultidisciplinary Approach envisioned in the ISC criteria.

An explosive-laden vehicle could penetrate the standoff \nperimeter and gain access to areas beneath the building. Proposed Security Design Solution\nTo reduce operational costs and consolidate security oversight, a shared guard \nbooth regulates access to both the underground parking garage and the loading \ndock. Guard arms designed as vehicular barriers control entry prior to security \nscreening. Hydraulic barriers prevent a vehicle from backing into the street in \nthe event that it needs to be detained. If possible, vehicles should be stopped \noutside the 50-foot standoff perimeter for inspection. Due to the constraints \nof this site and the space required for a truck to pull off the street completely to \navoid stopping traffic, the guard arm at the loading dock is located slightly \nwithin the standoff perimeter.

Protecting this open space without overuse of security \nelements can be challenging. Public space surrounded by bollards \nor Jersey barriers can seem forbidding to pedestrians and discourage \npublic use. It is critical to strike a balance between effective security \ndesign and quality public space to ensure the safety of users and \nfoster activity. 50-FT."

In an emergency, the plinths rotate to allow \nemergency vehicles into a dedicated fire lane. 4 A public plaza provides both passive and programmed open space.

Special thanks \nmust go to our consultant team, who worked closely with us to \nbring together text, image, and graphic organization so that our \nmessage was clear. Mary Ann Lasch, Heather Modzelewski, and \nElizabeth Riordan at Gensler; Jennifer Cosgrove, Samantha Harris, \nand Mark Rios at Rios Clementi Hale Studios; and Hyun Auh \nand Emanuela Frigerio at C&G Partners were all instrumental in \nmaking this project possible. Hinman Consulting Engineers and \nthe staff at Carol R. Johnson Associates contributed as members of \nthe consulting team at various stages. Government agencies and organizations provided invaluable \ninformation during roundtable meetings and reviews. In particular, \nthe National Capital Planning Commission, U.S. Commission of \nFine Arts, Federal Protective Service, Interagency Security \nCommittee, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Marshals Service played integral roles. Within GSA, staff from \nCentral Office and various Regional Offices demonstrated how \ncomprehensive design can create public buildings that are safe, \npleasant, and beneficial to their communities. The Center for \nHistoric Buildings in the Office of the Chief Architect showed the \nextra sensitivity one must demonstrate at historic facilities."

In response, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) conducted physical security assessments \nof 118 VA facilities, which resulted in 24 physical security strategies. The VA Secretary \napproved the Adoption of Physical Security Strategies for VA Facilities in 2006. Physical security \nand resiliency design requirements were developed to implement these strategies. This \nPhysical Security and Resiliency Design Manual (PSRDM) supersedes the 2015 Physical Security \nDesign Manuals (PSDM). Recommendations from the 2016 Value Management Study were \nconsidered when updating the PSRDM. The PSRDM represents exemplary collaboration across \nthe entire VA.

We wish to thank the \nfollowing for their valuable contributions and support to this Design Manual."

The physical \nsecurity and resiliency design and construction requirements in this manual apply to new \nbuildings, additions, and alteration/renovation of existing facilities and/or sites, owned by VA. \nCritical Facilities are those intended to remain fully functional during and following a natural or \nmanmade extreme event or a national emergency, in addition to protecting the life safety of \noccupants. Essential Facilities are those intended to remain functional with minor repairs \nduring and following a natural or manmade extreme event or a national emergency, in addition \nto protecting the life safety of occupants. Ancillary Facilities are those intended to protect the \nlife safety of occupants in case of an emergency. Although indispensable to the mission of VA, \nAncillary facilities are not required to remain operational during and following a natural or \nmanmade extreme event or a national emergency. These facilities are listed in section 1.4 of \nthis chapter. The previous edition (2015) of the Physical Security Design Manual (PSDM) provided in two \nseparate volumes the requirements for Mission Critical facilities and Life-Safety Protected \nfacilities (Mission Critical and Life-Safety Protected are now referred to as Critical and Ancillary, \nrespectively)."

The requirements also must be \ncoordinated with the requirements of the Life Safety Code, NFPA 101; the PSRDM does not \nsupersede any life-safety requirements, standards, or codes that have been recognized by VA.

A-2.2 Risk-Based Protective Design \nDespite a wide range of terrorist threats, including chemical-biological and cyber-attacks, \nexplosions remain the most insidious, requiring the least sophisticated materials and expertise \nto assemble and deploy. Without arousing any suspicion, the principal components of an \nexplosive device may be obtained at a variety of retail outlets. For this reason, VA requires the \nblast resistant protective design of VA facilities. These provisions recognize the risks and \nhazards associated with explosive events and prescribe different levels of protection based on \nthe nature of the structure and its criticality. The effectiveness of the PSRDM and the impact on the overall design is a balance between the \ncost of protective measures and the cost of regrets. The most beneficial protective measures \ntypically involve the design of anti-shatter facade systems and the hardening of structures to \nresist the effects of progressive collapse; however, the strategies differ for the design of new \nstructures and the upgrade of existing facilities. Risk management requires an evaluation of the range of threats and vulnerabilities of the \nfacility in response to the postulated threats."

In most \ncases, the vulnerability assessment primarily considers the life safety of occupants; however, \nfor critical facilities, the assessment must consider the continuity of operations, as applicable.

For blast hazard (and acts of terrorism in general) the events are virtually limitless and depend \non several factors such as the intent and resources of the aggressor. Since event occurrence is \na function of the characteristics of the target facility, actions that reduce the attractiveness of a \ntarget facility and/or deter certain types of events are typically assumed to reduce the \nlikelihood of occurrence. Vulnerability (V) refers to the damage or fragility model that is used to characterize the \noutcome or consequences of the event\u2019s occurrence. Vulnerability modeling requires the \nengineering analysis of the facility in order to determine responses for the loads induced by the \ninitiating event.

Although \nthe design to resist one extraordinary loading does not necessarily provide adequate protection \nin response to another extraordinary event, the basic requirements for ductility, redundancy, \nand robustness will contribute to the occupants\u2019 safety in response to a wide range of hazards \nand unforeseen events. All building components requiring blast resistance must be designed using established methods \nand approaches for determining dynamic loads, structural detailing, and dynamic structural \nresponse.

The distance of the protected structure from the point of explosive detonation is commonly \nreferred to as the standoff distance. As the front of the shock wave propagates away from the \nsource of the detonation at supersonic speed it expands into increasingly larger volumes of air, \nthe peak incident pressure at the shock front decreases and the duration of the pressure pulse \nincreases. Both the intensity of peak pressure and the impulse, which considers the effect of \nboth pressure intensity and pulse duration, affect the hazard potential of the blast loading. When an explosion occurs within an occupied space, the confinement of the explosive byproducts produces a quasi-static gas pressure that needs to be vented into the atmosphere. Near contact explosions impose a high impulse, high intensity pressure load over a localized \nregion of the structure, whereas standoff detonations typically produce a lower intensity \npressure that may engulf the entire structure.

At first glance, this may seem \ncounterintuitive; the peak blast load for Essential and Ancillary (W1 at 25-feet) is greater than \nthe peak blast load for Critical (W1 at 50-feet). However, the calculated blast loading for the \ndesign of the glazed fa\u00e7ade elements is limited to GP1 for Essential and Ancillary facilities and \nlimited to GP2 for Critical facilities.

Figure 10-1 illustrates the cyber lifecycle of ESS. Figure 10-1 ESS Cybersecurity Lifecycle \n \n10.2.2.1 Authorization (to Operate): On an open ESS architecture, where ESS are \nconnected to other VA systems through local area networks (LAN) or wide area \nnetworks (WAN), or simply connected to the Internet or extranet, the need to maintain \ndata security is critically important. In these circumstances, ESS must undergo \ninformation security authorization processes where the ESS are evaluated to ensure \ndata security is maintained. VA utilizes the National Institute for Science and \nTechnology (NIST) Special Publication 800 series and follows the Risk Management \nFramework (RMF). The facility OIT End User Operations (EUO) Area Manager (AM) is \nresponsible for the RMF process."

Very \nfew video systems today are either closed or completely analog, making CCTV an antiquated PHYSICAL SECURITY & RESILIENCY DESIGN MANUAL \nOctober 1, 2020 \n \nRevised 05-01-2024 \n \nGLOSSARY AND ACRONYMS \n11-2 \nterm and leading the security industry to use various terms to describe a video system. Because \nsecurity video serves two distinct purposes, assessment and surveillance, the term used here is \nvideo assessment and surveillance system or VASS. This provides a common term based on the \nfunctions the system serves, independent of technology."

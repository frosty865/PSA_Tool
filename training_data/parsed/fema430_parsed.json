The intended audience includes the design community of architects, landscape architects, engineers and other consultants \nworking for private institutions, building owners and managers and state \nand local government officials concerned with site planning and design. Immediately after September 11, 2001, extensive site security measures \nwere put in place, particularly in the two target cities of New York and \nWashington. However, many of these security measures were applied on \nan ad hoc basis, with little regard for their impacts on development patterns and community character. Property owners, government entities \nand others erected security barriers to limit street access and installed a \nwide variety of security devices on sidewalks, buildings, and transportation \nfacilities. The short-term impacts of these measures were certainly justified in the immediate aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001, but \ntraffic patterns, pedestrian mobility, and the vitality of downtown street \nlife were increasingly jeopardized."

      "text": "Hence, while the main objective of \nthis manual is to reduce physical damage to buildings and related infrastructure through site design, the purpose of FEMA 430 is also to ensure \nthat security design provides careful attention to urban design values by \nmaintaining or even enhancing the site amenities and aesthetic quality in \nurban and semi-urban areas. This publication, FEMA 430, is one of a series that addresses security issues in high-population private-sector buildings. It is a companion to the \nReference Manual to Mitigate Potential Terrorist Attacks Against Buildings \n(FEMA 426), which provides an understanding of the assessment of \nthreats, hazards, vulnerability, and risk, and the design methods needed \nto improve protection of new and existing buildings and the people occupying them. Chapter 2 of FEMA 426 provides guidance on site layout and \ndesign and discusses architectural and engineering design considerations \nfor risk mitigation, starting at the property line, including the orientation \nand placement of buildings on the site. This publication represents an expansion of Chapter 2 and focuses in more detail on information useful to \nthe site security design team."

These represent the most serious \nform of attack. Large trucks enable terrorists to carry very large amounts \nof explosives that are capable of causing casualties and destruction over a \nrange of many hundreds of yards. Perimeter barriers and protective design within the site can greatly reduce the possibility of vehicle penetration. Introduction of smaller explosive devices, carried in suitcases or backpacks, \nmust be prevented by pedestrian screening methods."

      "text": "Site design for security, however, may impact the function and amenity of \nthe site, and barrier and access control design may impact the quality of \nthe public space within the adjacent neighborhood and community. The \ndesigner\u2019s role is to ensure that public amenity and the aesthetics of the \nsite surroundings are kept in balance with security needs. This publication contains a number of examples in which the security/\namenity balance has been maintained through careful design and collaboration between designers and security experts. Much security design work \nsince September 11, 2001, has been applied to federal and state projects, \nand these provide many of the design examples shown. At present, federal government projects are subject to mandatory security guidelines \nthat do not apply to private sector projects, but these guidelines provide a \nvaluable information resource in the absence of comparable guidelines or \nregulations applying to private development. Operations and management issues and the detailed design of access \ncontrol, intrusion alarm systems, electronic perimeter protection, and \nphysical security devices, such as locking devices, are the province of the \nsecurity consultant and are not covered here, except as they may impact \nthe conceptual design of the site."

ORGANIZATION AND CONTENTS\nThis publication can be supplemented as needed with more extensive \ntechnical resources, and references are provided both in the text and in \nAppendix B. Chapter 1 discusses some basic design issues for site-related elements. It \nbegins by noting the evolution of site security design from the medieval \ncastle to today\u2019s measures, and leads to a discussion of the impact of security needs on site amenity and function. It describes current programs, \nstrategies, and publications devoted to site protection, and follows with Foreword and acknowledgments\niv\nshort summaries of selected terrorist attacks on buildings throughout the \nworld that provide specific lessons learned. A set of governing principles \nis followed by a discussion of the need for the integration of site security \ndesign with more familiar issues of site planning and design. Chapter 2 outlines the basics of the FEMA risk assessment process, the first \nsteps in determining the necessary measures to be designed and implemented. The chapter first discusses the determination of \u201cacceptable risk\u2019 \nand follows by outlining a five-step process that culminates in the selection of risk mitigation options."

      "text": "An explanation of explosive forces leads to \na discussion of the importance of stand-off distance. Finally, strategies for \nthe cost management of site security are outlined. The current absence \nof mandatory codes dealing with physical security is noted, leading to the \nneed for a performance-based approach to security design. Chapter 3 emphasizes that site security designers should look beyond \nthe project boundaries to seek to incorporate community resources and \ncreate design in harmony with the community values. The chapter begins \nby a discussion of the layers of defense concept, which structures the general approach to site security design. This is followed by a listing of the \nkey elements of security protection that are developed in detail in later \nchapters. A discussion of the community context within which security design must be implemented looks at four main issues: designing in tune \nwith the community context, respecting existing conditions, working with \nstakeholders, and the impact of regulatory requirements. Examples of site \ndesign are shown that illustrate the issues discussed in the text. Chapter 4 discusses a major element of security design -- that of providing a \nsecure perimeter defense for the site. This discussion is in two parts. First, \ngeneral issues of barrier system design are described, with emphasis on \nstriking a balance between security needs and the preservation of the amenity and day-to-day functions of the site."

      "text": "This section ends with a description \nof the present barrier crash test standards. This leads to the second and \nmajor part of the chapter that describes and illustrates the various types of \npassive and active barriers that are currently available and in use. Chapter 5 discusses the security design of open sites that incorporate a \nperimeter barrier and a vehicular approach to the building assets and onsite parking. This is the clearest expression of the three layers of defense \nmodel, which may take the form of a site for a single building or a campus \ntype with a number of buildings that are widely dispersed. The site within \nthe barrier forms a controlled access zone in which the design of the entry \ncontrol points is critical. Within this zone, major design tasks include \nbuilding placement (for new projects), orientation, sight lines, grading, \nand drainage. Other design issues include signage, parking, loading docks \nand service areas, physical security lighting, site utilities, and landscaping. Foreword and acknowledgments\nv\nChapter 6 discusses the special case of security design in the central business district in which space for stand-off distance may be severely limited \nor non-existent. Three generic site types are typical: buildings with zero \nsetback and alleys, buildings with yards, and buildings with plazas in \nwhich a larger public open space is provided on the site by the developer. Layers of defense for these sites are very compressed but still exist."

In other cases, however, the installation \nof security barriers has been acknowledged as detrimental to the func\u00ad\ntion, quality and viability of the public realm. Restricting access can cause \nsignificant traffic congestion and can create unnecessary obstacles on \nstreets and sidewalks, that minimize the efficiency of pedestrian and ve\u00ad\nhicle circulations systems and prevent the access of first responders in \nemergencies. How exposed we are to manmade disaster still remains a difficult ques\u00ad\ntion to answer in spite of the advances that have been made in the last few \nyears in identifying potential acts of terrorism. To stop a terrorist or phys\u00ad\nical attack on a site or building is very difficult. Any site can be breached \nor destroyed. Weapons, tools, and tactics can change faster than sites or \nbuildings can be modified. Terrorism involves violent acts or acts dan\u00ad\ngerous to human life. These acts appear to be intended to intimidate or \ncoerce a civilian population and influence government policy. Aggressor tactics run the gamut:\u2002 moving vehicle bombs; stationary ve\u00ad\nhicle bombs; bombs delivered by persons (suicide bombers); exterior \nattacks (thrown objects like rocks, Molotov cocktails, hand grenades, or \nhand-placed bombs); attack weapons (rocket-propelled grenades, light \nanti-tank weapons, etc."

Increasingly, the design community has become aware that security can \nno longer be viewed as a stand-alone capability. FEMA 430 promotes the \nadoption of sound mitigation measures that address both security needs \nand the functions, operations and aesthetic quality of the public realm. The better the site is designed to withstand a terrorist attack, the better BACKGROUND\n1-2\nthe odds the building will not be attacked or, if attacked, will suffer less \ndamage and more lives can be saved. FEMA endorses the view that the \nadoption of security measures can be, in many cases, cost-effective and \ncan increase the overall efficiency and performance of sites and buildings. FEMA promotes the fact that security design needs to go hand-in-hand \nwith good urban design practices and the preservation of urban land\u00ad\nscapes in which cities will remain as viable places in which to live."

A set of gov\u00ad\nerning principles is stated to guide a design team involved in balancing \nsecurity needs with urban design. A basic concept of security design promoted in this publication is the \nconcept of the three layers of defense, which is explained in Chapter 3, \nSection 3.2. The intent of this approach is to structure a defense in depth \nthat creates cumulative security barriers that must be penetrated. Finally, \nthe chapter closes by emphasizing the need for an integrated, holistic ap\u00ad\nproach to security design. 1.2 \nTHE EVOLUTION OF SITE SECURITY \nDESIGN\n1.2.1 Some Historical Background\nT\nhe design of buildings to protect occupants from attack is as old \nas the history of architecture itself. The development of gun\u00ad\npowder and cannon in the middle ages forced walls to become \nlower and thicker in protection against cannon balls. The eventual \nresult was the bastioned fort, which was developed in increasingly \nelaborate forms."

The design of military structures to resist artillery fire or bombs is a spe\u00ad\ncialized task that does not normally enter into the design of everyday \nbuildings.

The WTC towers had been designed to withstand the accidental impact \nof a Boeing 707 seeking to land at a nearby airport; the airplane was esti\u00ad\nmated to have a gross weight of 263,000 pounds and a flight speed of 180 \nmph with a modest fuel load. The Boeing 767-ER type aircrafts that hit \nboth towers on September 11 had estimated \ngross weights of 274,000 pounds and flight \nspeeds of 470 to 590 mph on impact with nearfull loads of fuel. The burning fuel proved to \nbe the deciding factor in the collapse of the \ntowers.

A decision \nto include aircraft impact as a design parameter for a building would \nclearly result in a major change in the design, livability, usability, and cost \nof buildings. The bomb delivered by car or truck is the terrorist weapon \nof choice against buildings because it is relatively simple to mount an at\u00ad\ntack. As was shown in the United States in Oklahoma City in 1995, a \nsingle large bomb exploded close to the Murrah federal building in \nOklahoma City, causing devastating damage and many casualties (Figure \n1-3). While vehicle barriers would clearly not protect against an air attack, \nfor the Murrah building a properly designed barrier system and ade\u00ad\nquate stand-off would probably have significantly reduced the impact of \nthe attack. A summary of the attack on the Murrah building is provided \nin Section 1.5.2.6."

However, the site may be close to one or more high-profile targets, in \nwhich case the entire site and any adjacent buildings will be subject to \ncollateral effects, which will vary in severity depending on the proximity \nto the target and the magnitude of the attack. Security strategies and devices had been under development since the \nembassy bombings of the 1980s. The Department of State began imple\u00ad\nmenting perimeter protection and access control at some embassies to \nprevent vehicles from penetrating into critical areas within the facilities. At the same time, extensive research was undertaken on the resistance \nof buildings to blast and issues such as progressive collapse and glass \nbreakage. Military planners also developed formal methodologies for the \nassessment of threats, vulnerabilities, and risk. Figure 1-3:\u2002 \nThe Murrah Federal \nBuilding, Oklahoma \nCity 1995.

In \n1995 the federal Interagency Security Committee (ISC) was established \nby Executive Order 12977 to develop long-term construction standards \nfor locations requiring blast resistance or other specialized security \nmeasures. In a series of working group discussions, the ISC revised and \nupdated GSA\u2019s  Security Criteria, taking into account technology de\u00ad\nvelopments, the experience of practitioners applying the criteria, and \nrecognition of the need to balance security requirements with building \nenvironments that remain open, lively, and accessible. The result was \nSecurity Design Criteria for New Federal Buildings and Major Modernization \nProjects, published in 2001. The GSA and ISC documents are significant \nin that they were the first attempt to truly integrate security into every \nfacet of the design and construction of a facility for non-Departmentof-Defense (DoD) organizations. Prior to these documents, security was \ngenerally an afterthought:\u2002 the last item added and the first item cut \nfrom any typical project. Over the past several years, many facility owners who are not required \nto implement the ISC requirements have adapted and adopted the cri\u00ad\nteria.

FEMA has \nprovided an ongoing series of publications providing guidelines for a \nnumber of aspects of security design that are described in Section 1.4. From the experience and studies of blast effects on buildings, the impor\u00ad\ntance of distance (between the building and the bomb) became recognized \nand led to the concept of the protected setback, now called stand-off, as \nan effective mitigation of blast. In turn, this has led to stand-off distance re\u00ad\nquirements becoming a standard element in security design and a de facto \nregulatory requirement in the design of buildings constructed or leased \nby federal government agencies. This one issue alone at once highlighted \nthe site as a major security design arena, and site planning became a major \nfactor in the aim to reduce the effect of explosive attack. In 1997 the United States Air Force Center for Environmental \nExcellence published Installation Force Protection Guide that included \nchapters that covered comprehensive planning and facility site planning.

More recently, building \nregulations have addressed natural disasters that are threats to life safety \n(hurricanes, tornados, floods, earthquakes, and snow storms) through \nprescriptive design requirements, accepted analyses, physical tests, \nreference standards, and inspection requirements. Some man-made risks, \nsuch as HazMat storage, have also been addressed in this way.

These minimum standards do not, however, guarantee com\u00ad\nplete safety or even a defined level of performance.

Explosive pressures encountered in design are typically much greater than other loads that are considered, but \nthey decay extremely rapidly with time and space. As a rule of thumb, \nthe pressures generated by the shock wave increase linearly with the \nsize of the weapon, usually measured in equivalent pounds of TNT, and \ndecrease exponentially with the distance from the explosion. The duration of the explosion is extremely short, measured in thousandths of a \nsecond, or milliseconds. As the shock wave expands, the incident or overpressure decreases. When \nit encounters a surface that is in line-of-sight of the explosion, the wave is \nreflected, resulting in a tremendous amplification of pressure on the surface of the object:\u2002 shock waves can reflect with an amplification factor of \nup to about 12. The magnitude of the reflection factor is a function of the \nproximity of the explosion and the angle of incidence of the shock wave on DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n2-20\nthe surface (with incidence normal to the targets resulting in the maximum \npressure). Late in the explosive event, the shock wave becomes negative, \nfollowed by a partial vacuum, which creates suction behind the shock wave \nthat can cause windows to fall outwards."

Immediately following the vacuum, air rushes in, creating a powerful wind \nor drag pressure on all surfaces of the building.

This is \nbecause, as noted above, the blast loading decays rapidly with the \ndistance. In general, if the distance is doubled, the blast loading is reduced by a factor of 3 to 8, based upon the distance to the building and \nthe TNT equivalent weight, with the smaller reduction applicable to \nsmaller distances. Figures 2-12 and 2-13 and Table 2-3 illustrate the influence of stand-off \non building damage and casualties. These graphics provide only a broad \nindication of the effects, which will vary considerably depending on the \ntype of construction, age and quality of the building, its location, and its \nconfiguration. Figure 2-12 represents the level of protection offered by conventional construction at a given stand-off.

The key element in protecting buildings from a vehicular \nbomb is the establishment of appropriate stand-off distance, depending \non the size of the threat and the building characteristics. This is accom\u00ad\nplished by a protective barrier system placed to provide at least minimum \nrequired stand-off. In an urban situation, this is often not possible, and al\u00ad\nternative measures must be taken. These are discussed in Chapter 6. The barrier may be along the site property line or, within a large site or \ncampus, placed independently of the property line. When along the prop\u00ad\nerty line, the barrier forms the interface between public and private space, \nand thus, in an urban setting, it may have major visual and functional im\u00ad\npacts on city amenities."

A perimeter security design involves two main elements:\u2002 the perimeter \nbarrier that prevents unauthorized vehicles and pedestrians from en\u00ad\ntering the site, and access control points at which vehicles and pedestrians \ncan be screened and, if necessary, inspected before they pass through the \nbarrier. Barrier system design and types of barriers are described in this \nchapter. Access control points are described in Chapter 5, Section 5.3, \nand Chapter 6, Section 6.5, for open and urban sites, respectively. The following are suggested as some of the goals of perimeter security \nplanning:\nm To provide an appropriate balance between the need to accommodate \nperimeter security for sensitive buildings and their occupants, and the \nneed to maintain the vitality of the public realm. m To provide security in the context of streetscape enhancement and \npublic realm beautification, rather than as a separate or redundant \nsystem of components whose only purpose is security."

Perimeter protection may participate in all three layers of defense. The first layer applies when the access control is outside the property \nline. The second layer applies when there is controlled access around \na building within the property line. The third layer applies to under\u00ad\nground parking, or parking underneath a plaza (see Chapter 6, Section \n6.4). It also applies when the access control is at the building face.

SECURITY DESIGN FOR THE OPEN SITE\n5-2\nThe defended perimeter may or may not be on the site property line. Each site needs to be evaluated to determine the location and types \nof barriers for the protected area. Typically, the barrier designates the \nstand-off distance around the building. If possible, this should not be \nless than the minimum recommended, and if the site permits, it may be \nconsiderably more. Intelligence gathering in this layer of defense is im\u00ad\nportant, and cameras and sensors should be installed at entrances and \naround the perimeter.

SECURITY DESIGN FOR THE OPEN SITE\n5-27\nAt entry control points, a minimum surface lighting average of 4 hori\u00ad\nzontal foot-candles will help ensure adequate lighting for pedestrians, \nislands, and guards. Where practical, high-mast lighting is recommended, \nbecause it gives a broader, more natural light distribution, requires fewer \npoles (less hazardous to the driver), and is more aesthetically pleasing \nthan standard lighting. Lighting of the entry control point should give \ndrivers a clear view of the gatehouse and, for security personnel, a clear \nview of vehicles in the area. The type of site lighting system used depends on the overall requirements \nof the site and the building. Four types of lighting are used for security \nlighting systems:\nm Continuous lighting is the most common security lighting system. It consists of a series of fixed lights arranged to flood a given area \ncontinuously during darkness with overlapping cones of light."

It is a strong deterrent to a potential intruder because it \nmakes him or her very visible, while making it difficult to see \ninside the secure area. Guards are protected by being kept in \ncomparative darkness while being able to observe intruders \nat a considerable distance. This method should not be used \nwhen the glare of lights directed across the surrounding \nterritory could annoy or interfere with adjacent operations. m Controlled lighting is best when there are limits to the \nlighted area outside the perimeter, such as along highways. In \ncontrolled lighting, the width of the lighted strip is controlled \nand adjusted to fit the particular need. This method of \nlighting may illuminate or silhouette security personnel. m Standby lighting has a layout similar to continuous lighting; however, \nthe lights are not continuously lit, but are either automatically or \nmanually turned on when suspicious activity is detected or suspected \nby security personnel or alarm systems. m Movable lighting consists of manually operated, movable searchlights \nthat may be lit during hours of darkness or as needed.

Because in the urban situation, air intakes may be situ\u00ad\nated adjacent to a public sidewalk, location and protection of intakes is \nimportant. Personal protection refers to equipment such as respirators, \nescape hoods, CBR detectors, decontamination equipment, etc., which \nwould be used by trained personnel. CBR releases have two components \u2013 terrorism and hazardous materials \n(industrial accidents). Terrorism has a lower likelihood but a higher con\u00ad\nsequence, involving high concentrations of a contaminant agent targeted \nagainst a specific site or building. Hazardous material accidents are the \nopposite \u2013 higher likelihood but somewhat lower consequence \u2013 due to \nprobable lower concentrations and doses (accumulated concentrations \nover time), since the building or site is not directly targeted.

Three aspects of site planning and design have a bearing on CBR protection:\nm Placement and orientation of a new building should take into account \nprevailing winds, although the actual wind direction and speed at the \ntime of an outdoor release will directly affect the building. m The surrounding terrain may result in channeling a CBR release \ntowards the site and building. m Building elevation is relevant, because heavier-than-air contaminants \nwill have greater impacts upon low-lying areas, as the agent hugs the \nground as it disperses. Thus, since most CBR agents are heavier than \nair, raising air intakes on buildings is the most beneficial action to take. Lighter-than-air CBR agents would be of greater concern if the pre\u00ad\nvailing wind directed the agent to the air intakes (in a similar manner \nto reflected blast pressure on the face of a building), and the air intakes \npulled the agent into the building because the HVAC equipment was still \noperating. Placing the air intakes on the side away from the prevailing \nwind should reduce the agent uptake into the building, since the wind \nclears the agent around the building and the intakes are somewhere \nsheltered against the wind."

The City of New York and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) took immediate steps to secure \nthe perimeter of the financial district. The city's public spaces suffer from heavy-handed, quick-fix \ninstallations of cumbersome security devices that mar the experience of the public realm. The financial district is a close irregular pattern of \nstreets heavily traveled by automobiles, service \nvehicles, and pedestrians; to create sufficient \nstand-off for the NYSE would entail closing a \nnumber of streets. This was initially accomplished \nby a vast array of jersey barriers, barricades, \nand stationary pick-up trucks to block incoming \ntraffic, together with increased security personnel \nand manned check points that had a negative \neffect on the quality of the city's public spaces.

In 1971, architect Oscar Newman published a paper, \u201cArchitectural \nDesign for Crime Prevention,\u201d and in 1973 published a book, Defensible \nSpace, Crime Prevention through Urban Design. His studies of urban resi\u00ad\ndential areas showed how physical design contributed to victimization by \ncriminals. Newman explored the concepts of human territoriality, nat\u00ad\nural surveillance, and the modification of existing structures to effectively \nreduce crime, ideas that still form the foundation of building security de\u00ad\nsign today. Newman\u2019s work became the foundation for what later became \nknown as \u201cCrime Prevention through Environmental Design\u201d (CPTED). The term \u201cCrime Prevention through Environmental Design\u201d had first \nappeared in a 1971 book by criminologist and sociologist C. Ray Jeffery, \ninspired by Jacobs\u2019s work. Jeffrey analyzed the causation of crime from \nan interdisciplinary approach, drawing from criminal law, sociology, psy\u00ad\nchology, the administration of justice, criminology, penology, and other \nfields. He also drew from relatively new fields at that time, including \nsystems analysis, decision theory, environmentalism, behaviorism, and sev\u00ad\neral models of crime control."

In this period of evolution, the CPTED methodology was organized to \nmatch the function of the crime area, similar to Newman\u2019s layering of \nspace from private to public spaces. CPTED now defines three basic strat\u00ad\negies for security design: natural access control, natural surveillance, and \nterritorial reinforcement. DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND CPTED: ORIGINS AND APPLICATION\nA-2\nA.2 \nCPTED BASIC STRATEGIES\nm Natural access control consists of symbolic and real barriers that \nprevent the criminal from committing a crime. Natural access control strategies involve decreasing opportunities for \ncrime by denying access to crime targets and creating a perception of \nrisk in offenders. It is accomplished by the design of streets, sidewalks, \nbuilding entrances, and neighborhood gateways to mark public \nroutes, and by use of architectural and landscape structural elements \nto discourage access to private areas. m Natural surveillance increases the awareness by residents or building \nusers of who leaves and enters the property or buildings."

    {
      "page": 257,
      "text": "Natural surveillance strategies are intended to make intruders easily \nobservable. Features that maximize visibility of people, parking areas, \nand building entrances promote natural surveillance. Examples \nare doors and windows that look onto streets and parking areas, \npedestrian friendly sidewalks and streets, front porches, and adequate \nnighttime lighting. m Territorial reinforcement involves creating a sense of the users\u2019 \nproprietorship so that offenders perceive a territorial influence. Territorial reinforcement strategies use physical design to create or \nextend a sphere of influence. Building users are trained to develop \na sense of territorial control so that potential intruders will perceive \nthis control and be discouraged from their criminal intentions. Features such as landscape planting, pavement surface design \ngateway treatments, and fences are used to define property lines and \nhelp distinguish private from public spaces to promote territorial \nreinforcement. CPTED then divides each of these three strategies into response \nclassifications:\nm Natural concepts use design tools for avoiding user conflicts and \nproviding clear circulation paths. These concepts employ physical and spatial features, such as site and \narchitectural elements, to ensure that a setting acts as a deterrent to \ncrime while supporting the intended use of the space. Examples of \nnatural features include landscaping, outdoor seating and planters, \nfences, gates, and walls."

Windows \nmay have protective glazing that withstands blows without breaking. Doors and window hardware may have special material and mountings \nwhich make them hard to remove or tamper with. Walls, floors, or \ndoors may be specially reinforced in high-security areas with materials \nthat are difficult to penetrate. m Organizational concepts respond with management and personnel \ntechniques.
